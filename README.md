# Car Type Prediction Model

This repository contains a machine learning model designed for predicting the price of second-hand cars. The model utilizes TensorFlow, Pandas, Seaborn, Cartopy, and TensorFlow's API for implementation.

## Overview

- **Data Preparation:**
  - The model is trained using the "train.csv" dataset, employing Pandas for loading and preprocessing. This includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features for optimal performance.

- **Model Training:**
  - TensorFlow and Keras APIs were used for training the car type prediction model.

- **Model Testing:**
  - A comprehensive testing process was conducted to evaluate the model's performance.

- **Data Visualization:**
  - Seaborn was employed for data exploration and visualization, including the creation of insightful bar plots.

## Dependencies

- TensorFlow's API
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Cartopy


## Installation
